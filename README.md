Simple todo list, using HTML, CSS and some object oriented Javascript. User can add a 'todo' activity via input panel and either mark it as completed by clicking on it or delete the activity by clicking the bin icon, 'todos' are stored in a local storage, so user can freely refresh the page! Works on mobile!
